Problem Statement:Evolutive dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which involves a disorder in reading and writing. It is a permanent neurodevelopment condition with an unknown genetic cause which commonly occurs in people with a medium or high intellectual capacity.Globally, an estimated 700 million people or about one in ten individuals are believed to be living with dyslexia.

Proposed Solution: Design and develop a Chrome extension aimed at improving the reading experience for individuals with dyslexia by addressing following challenges:
1.font readability (injects dyslexia friendly font into web pages)
2.Text summarizer
3.Image generation (using DALL E from OpenAI)
4.differentiation of visually similar alphabets and numbers by highlighting

We can add more features like:
Support in different languages including different audios for text-to-speech
1.Word prediction and autocorrect
2.Customizable background and text colours
3.Voice command and dictation
4.Text enlargement and spacing adjustments
